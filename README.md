# AugHyE
Official implementation of "AugHyE: flexible aligned unbound structure augmentation with hybrid encoder for robust protein binding interface prediction"

## Abstract

**TL;DR:** We propose a novel method for tackling dynamic many-objective molecular optimization problem by utilizing objective decomposition and progressive optimization. 

## Docker:
Note that our code is heavily dependent on and built from the PMO benchmark code, which can be found [here](https://github.com/wenhao-gao/mol_opt).

You can simply test run the AugHyE code by using the following command:
```bash
python test.py
```
## Conda activation:
You can simply test run the AugHyE code by using the following command:
```bash
python test.py
```
## Experiments:
You can simply test run the AugHyE code by using the following command:
```bash
python test.py
```
Train code & unbound structure augmentation will be availible upon publication.

## Colab Notebook:
The Colab notebook for this project can be found here: [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iiDNJDSDEqcjRJNT402hz5B3I_boN3Mw#scrollTo=9tnOBuBOprD6)

### Important Note
As of May 17, 2024, the notebook `DyMol Colab Notebook.ipynb` has been tested and is working correctly. However, please be aware that changes in library versions or updates to the Colab environment may affect its functionality in the future.
